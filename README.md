# AlienAlley
Source port of Alien Alley demo game by Dave Roberts.
This was a FreeBASIC/Allegro/Win32 port/conversion of the Alien Alley game by Dave Roberts done by me.
Which, I am now returning to C/C++ using Allegro 5. Homecoming!
This is the same game that came with the book PC Game Programming Explorer.
I bought this book a long time ago and indeed what a wonderful book it is.
The original game was written in C for DOS. The conversion was not very simple though.
A lot has changed in the code. If you want to compile the code, you will need Visual Studio 2019 Community.
I do not accept responsibility for any effects, adverse or otherwise, that this code may have on you, your computer, your sanity, your dog, and anything else that you can think of. Use it at your own risk.
